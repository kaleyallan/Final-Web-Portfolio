<h2> Saint Joseph's University</h2>

<p>
I am currently a second year student at Saint Joseph's University with a Communications Major and a Music Industry Minor. 
I am studying to get a job somewhere in the music industry either in the Philadelphia area or in New Jersey. 
I am currently the president of 1851 Entertainment on campus which functions as a record label, as well as puts on student run music showcases during each semester. 

</p>

<p>
Through 1851 Entertainment I have started a biweekly open mic that takes place right in the middle of campus that starts at the begining of each semester.
I have also booked shows at The Grape Room in Manayunk and The Perch on campus that showcases Saint Joes own students with a variety of music genres.
