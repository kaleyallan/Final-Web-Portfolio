<h2>Internships:</h2>

<div class="internship">
<ol>Livenation: </ol>
<ul>At Livenation I worked under booking assistant Molly Warren. I interned my entire senior year of highschool and the summer going into my freshman year of college.
I learned how to put together contracts for upcoming concerts in the Philadelphia area, as well as updatind the calenders of the other concert bookers in the office.
Overall I was able to take away how this particular job works and how important each step is to the production of the actual show. 
</ul>

<ol>Electric Factory</ol>
<ul>At the Electric Factory I worked under talent buyer Bryan Dilworth. I was in charge of planning their charity event with Devereux where every donation garunteed someone a concert ticket of their choice. 
I also helped put together contracts for upcoming shows at the Electric Factory.</ul>

<ol>The Trocadero</ol>
<ul>At the Trocadero I worked under Andrew Lipke to put on "The Last Waltz" which was a tribute to The Band. 
I helped get the stage set up as well as making sure the dressing rooms were set up accordingly. This internship taught me the hard work and time that goes into setting up a concert that only lasts a few hours.
</ul>

<h2>Work:</h2>
<ol>Oaks Early Learning Center</ol>
<ul>Working at Oaks Early Learning Center taught me patience and responsibility by having to deal with up to 15 children 5 and under at a time.
I had to help the teachers make lesson plans for each week and make sure to keep them all interested in what we were doing each day.
</ul>
<ol>Shannondell Retirement Home</ol>
<ul> I worked at Shannondell as a server in one of their restraunts within the Retirement Community.</ul>
